# Tweet Verifier
**Tweet verifier** aims to prevent the spread of false information. Users may submit a tweet by using their ethereum wallets to create immutable records of it. 

## Smart Contract

For deployment, go to [Ethereum Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org). Upload the *tweet-verifier.sol*. Use a compatible solidity version(^0.4.0 - 0.6.0) to compile. (*You may get some warnings about some solidity features that are still beta.*)

Go to deployment section. For demo purpose, **Javascript VM** can be used. Or **injected Web3** for on-chain tests. Vertical navigation in *Deploy, Run & Transactions* section show the contract and allows you to transact to contract. There are two functions: one for submitting new tweet record and a function to query tweet record by id.
